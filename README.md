Space Simulator was a project I created back in mid-2022, my motivation was to improve my knowledge on coding fundamentals while creating a fun project. 
While creating this project I learnt a great deal about coding fundamentals such as user inputs, while loops, imports(random in this case), and if statements.
In this project I especially focused on understanding while loops and how they worked.
